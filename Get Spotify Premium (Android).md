This short guide will show you how to get **Spotify Premium** on your tablet or phone without ads and with playback of songs in the order you want, skipping the limitations that Free users have by default.

It is a bunch of simple steps to modify the original apk and generate a new one removing the anoying ads, but with some limitations, such as not being able to download music or play offline content (that part is server-side).

Beforehand I clarify that you will not have to spend a penny to do this, nor do you run the risk of downloading a virus or other malware. The method has been tested by several people besides me.

## Step by step:

Before you start, if you're on a Google phone, go to the Play Store and disable Play Protect. This will prevent Google from reporting the apks you will use next, as viruses as it tends to throw false positives. In addition, you must allow the installation of unknown Apps. We will use external apps that are not found in the Google store. You can refer to this [guide](tid) for this.

1. Download the latest official version of Spotify from the Google Play Store (or other reliable site).

2. Export the installed Apk to the external storage (for this I recommend using MT Manager, a powerful file explorer, you can download it [here](https://mt-manager.en.uptodown.com/android) ). The process is simple: 

<ol type="A">
<li>Open the left sidebar dots.</li>
<li>Select the option that says "Extract APK".</li>
<li>In the "APP USER" tab look for "Spotify". </li>
<li>Tap the apk icon and then tap on "EXTRACT APK".</li>
<li>Wait until the process gets completed.</li>
</ol>

- **Note:** *exported apps are saved to the "MT2" folder on the device). Once exported, you can uninstall Spotify from your phone and start creating your MOD version in the following steps.*

3. Next, download AntiSplitM [here](https://github.com/AbdurazaaqMohammed/AntiSplit-M/releases) . It is a tool that combines separate apks from an .apks or .xapk file as a single apk. Open the application and select the Spotify version you just exported in the previous step. Choose where to save the resulting file. 

- **Note:** *you may want to delete the .apks/xapk and keep the converted file (by default it is suffixed with "_antisplit" so you can easily identify it).

4. Therefore, download ReVanced Manager [here](https://revanced.app/download) . This application is used to manage every app you've installed on your device, applying patches that can change its functionality at will. In this case, you will use it to create a modified version of Spotify. In order to do this:

<ol type="A">
<li>Open the program and go to the "Patcher" tab.</li>
<li>Tap "Select an application."</li>
<li>In the new window, tap the "Storage" button and find the Spotify app you saved. </li>
<li>Next, tap "Select Patches", check the "Spoof signature" and "Unlock Spotify Premium" options.</li>
<li>Tap "Complete" and then "Patch". Wait for the process to finish.</li>
<li>Once the process is complete, install the modified APK and enjoy.</li>
</ol>

# Tips:

You can also choose to install xManager as an alternative if you don't want to follow the steps above. In this application you can download different versions of Spotify that are already patched to activate the premium, you can find it [here](https://www.xmanagerapp.com/) . However, it is worth noting that following the above procedures gives you the advantage of having the latest MOD version of Spotify before anyone else for your device architecture.
